Status: WIP
not tested :)

Note:

all <img> tags should have 
	* their width/height set
  * alt text (except your spacers)
  * title text (unless its parents is a <a> link, then use that)
	* display block; outline: none; border: none; etc. Use image_fix class for that:
<img class="image_fix" src="full path to image" alt="Your alt text" title="Your title text" width="x" height="x" />

all <a> links should have
  * target="_blank"
